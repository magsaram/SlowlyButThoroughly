It's quite big page for me. I want to try position: fixed in nav and scroll function. 

Another thing I want to try was "package section". I made it in only in CSS so I must think a lot and combine, but I did it and I like it. I know, it's better to do it in JS, but I don't know yet JS. I won't change it in future, I want to have pages as I done it. I rather do something new with new knowlege. I can see my progress.
